        Using this Sacrament Meeting Planner, you will find it is easy to add member names to a database, and select up to 4 hymns and members for each meeting from searchable drop-down lists by starting to type in the select box:
        <ul>
            <li>up to 7 speakers,</li>
            <li>intermediate musical numbers</li>
            <li>and Invocations/Benedictions</li>
        </ul> 
           You can search for the names by first name or last name, and hymns by number or title.
